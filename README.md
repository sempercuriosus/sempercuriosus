# About Me

Hi 👋 My name is Eric! 

Here are a few things about me: 

## Bio
---

I have been coding learning what to do one project at a time since 2015 earning an AAS in Application Development, and I am currently pivoting to Full-Stack Web Developmen, having recently graduated from UNCC's Code Bootcamp! 

🌍  I'm based on the East Coast, USA, South Carolina, hailing from 🧀 Wisconsin 🦡 originally.

🌱 Currently Learning: Full Stack Web Development! (MERN Tech-Stack)

⚡ I find joy in continuous learning, problem-solving, and exploring new experiences. In my rag-tag basement woodshop, I love working with my hands, crafting and creating. From fixing cars, tackling house projects, and to improvising solutions. My favorite improvisation is using a #2 pencil to addressing the resistance level in the gas leak sensor in my water heater. The graphite from the pencil increased the sensor's resistance, getting it back into the right tolerance range, while the new sensor was on the way! Cold water in Wisconsin winter was not my favorite.

Outside of the technical realm, I'm drawn to nature. Whether it's hiking, biking, leisurely walks, or simply sitting in the grass, I find solace in the outdoors, often taking moments to appreciate the clouds drifting by.
